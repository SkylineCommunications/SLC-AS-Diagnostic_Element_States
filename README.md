# Diagnostic_Element_States

This tool allows you to dump the element states at a certain point in time, and then restore those element states afterwards. This can be very useful in situation where you need to stop all elements in a cluster, for doing an upgrade for instance, and then you might need to restore the state of the elements after the upgrade to that previous it.
